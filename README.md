This Proof of Concept is a personal project and created to explore simple ways to

1: Create two-way databinding in the front
2: Make any change in the page visible on other machines, using event messages sent via websockets


The code contains three parts:

1: A small client side framework to render HTML and do 2-way databinding with data objects
2: A small server side framework using websockets to share events between different browser clients
3: A set of convenient classes, written for convenience and as exploration of certain concepts
